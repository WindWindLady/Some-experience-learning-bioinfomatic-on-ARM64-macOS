# Some-experience-learning-bioinformatic-on-ARM64-macOS
Hi, you can call me John or `WindWindLady`, the nickname. This `README` may have lots of grammatical or some weird writing errors, please point them out! I'll appreciate it because you're helping me improve my writing skill.

I'm a graduate student majored in genetics. When deciding to learn this major, I heard that bioinformatic approaches will be needed in the rest of my career and Unix-like OSs such as `Linux` and `macOS` has advantages doing the analyses. So I'm using the newest MacBook Pro with M2 Pro chip. Obviously, the choice is not a good idea, for almost every software in bioinformatic is stilled compiled under `x86-64` architecture instead of `arm64`. And `macOS` does not have the kind of instant translating ability when softwares using x86-based library (not `Rosetta 2`, it won't work when compiling). So, I've spent lots of time learning how to run the software in need. 

I'm not talking about the disadvantages about OS or computing architecture. I just want to say it is VERY IMPORTANT to choose a fitting tool for the work.

All above is the reason I want to open this project. I wanna share my experience to help those who have similar problems whether or not I can really help. For me, it's a pleasure to give other people clues to solve the darn problems (sorry about the language). Also it's my first time using GitHub's project function. I hope we can improve the ability together!

# About the Hardware and OS
- M2 Pro chip with 12-core CPU & 19-core GPU
- 32 GB of Unified Memory
- macOS 14.0 Sonoma (may update when releasing new version)

# The Software I'm Using (Will Keep Updating)

- Homebrew (for installing)
- VS Code (IDE sometimes)
- R Studio with R 4.3.0
- CTL for Xcode
- Parallels Desktop (for using some GIS software or software incompatible with macOS)
- Anaconda (for bioinformatic virtual environments)
- bwa 0.7.17 (installed via Homebrew)
- samtools 1.18 (locally compiled and running well)
- ***gemma 0.97*** (openblas and gsl installed but cannot installed 0.98.x via Homebrew or locally complied)
- GenALEx (Excel Macro)

### Softwares below are running in Windows VM
- Bayescan ï¼ˆGUI version which not supported multi-thread)
- Structure 
- Arlequin 
- Dataformater 
- PGDSpider 
- ArcMap 10.8

I may not list all the softwares and their version using now because of the number, and please make sure you have installed the prerequisite environments or libraries when reading my journals.

# Journal Links

Not Now, I'm writing but it needs time.

# Last but not Least

Maybe I take GitHub as a journal or log website, not a platform sharing the codes. But I want to learn, to study. I think it will be a good way to communicate. There may be not any release in this project but I may share some codes files. With the help from kinds of communities, I may send an article to Cell, Nature or Science one day. Maybe. (LOL)
